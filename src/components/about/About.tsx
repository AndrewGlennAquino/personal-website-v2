            Hello and nice to meet you! My name is Andrew Aquino and I'm a
            software engineer for Revature and freelance full stack developer
            who enjoys creating accessible, aesthetically pleasing websites. I
            specialize in TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and I focus on clean
            design, responsiveness, and accessibility. As a software engineer
            for Revature, I train in client-specific tech stacks to easily
            integrate into development teams and production environments and
            instantly contribute robust, clean code. As a freelance full stack
            developer, I collaborate with local businesses and entrepreneurs to
            deliver modern, responsive, and SEO optimized websites for free with
            little to no overhead. I'm always on the lookout for freelance or
            full-time opportunities!
